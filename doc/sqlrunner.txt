Variables that can be def (or set) to tweak the behavior of SQLRunner


console     startup an interactive interface (command prompt thing).

catalog     current catalog
schema      current schema

showvar NAME    shows the value of variable.

env     on/off  display environment right before executing anything.

log     on/off  display log (what query is being executed, and how long it takes).

pretend
debug   on/off  don't actually hit the database.


db      name of database to use. defaults to "db".

url     has the form of db_url (where "db" is whatever database name "db" variable is set to).

user    has the form of db_user (username for database).
pass    has the form of db_pass (password for database).
driver  has the form of db_driver (name of jdbc driver class; this has to be in classpath).

show tables: command to display all table names.
show catalogs: command to display all catalogs.
show schemas: command to display all schemas.
show views:  shows all views.
show table types: command to display all table types.

desc TABLENAME;
describe TABLENAME;     display details of a table.

info    display database informatio (database name, version, username).


outformat   csv/html    Picks output format. Default is csv.
                (note that html output can be saved with .xls extension).

dateformat  what format output dates default to; default is yyyyMMdd.

delim       The delimiter to use in "csv" output. Default is ','

head        Display column names for all output.
fhead       Display column names and types for all output.

last        Variable that stores the last row of the last resultset.


     * of <?= $somevariable ?>, &&somevariable, \&somevariable with

lineno      display input line numbers at the command prompt.


/*   */     multiline comments.

#, --, //   single line comments.

gocmd       run buffer. default value '/'. Similar to '/' in sqlplus.

cmdseparator    run last command. default value ';'. Similar to ';' in just about all databases.

errors  on/off  flag to determine if errors cause program termination 


set name1 name2 name3... off
set name1 name2 name3... on
            set a particular variable to on/off value.


def name=value
define name='value';
        define a variable to a particular value.


spool filename
    write output of sql queries to this output.

    if filename ends with .gz, then output is gzip compressed, example:
    
    def tdate='20080101';
    spool &&tdate._data.csv.gz

    will write output to 20080101_data.csv.gz, etc.

spool off   close previous output. start writing to standard output.

@filename   include file. this can be recursive.
    if filename ends with .properties, the file is loaded as system properties.


exit        exit the whole program (with exit code 0).

quit        stop processing current input. this is similar to exit, unless we're in an included file (see @filename).


command line usage:
    - (read standard input).
    file.properties     load the properties file.
    file.sql            run the sql file.
    name=value      sets variable to that value.
    name            sets varialbe "name" to value 'on'.




COLUMNNAME_format to replace default column format, ie: 

echo "
def COLNAME_format='yyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss';
select colname 
from blahtable partition (blahtable_20080418);
" |sqlrunner db=somedb head - |head 

to_char(colname,'YYYYMMDD') and to_char(colname,'HH24MISS')
